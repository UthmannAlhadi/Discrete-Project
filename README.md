## Project Background

The Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail (HSR) was a proposed train route that would connect Singapore with Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia via a high-speed rail line. Najib Razak, the former prime minister of Malaysia, made the initial proposal in September 2010. The collaborative project was officially approved in February 2013 by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, with the HSR's initial completion date set for 2026. The HSR line would have been 350 km long and was expected to reduce travel time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to 90 minutes. It would have departed from Bandar Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur and connected with other towns along the west coast of West Malaysia on its way to Jurong East in Singapore. Cities along the way would have included Malacca and Seremban.

## Mathematical Problem

Based on the project trigger, a mathematical model using Dijkstra algorithm is developed to find the minimum path linking Kuala Lumpur and Singapore for a High-Speed Rail (HSR) project by implementing discrete structures, which are graphs and algorithms.


## Station Code

Table 2.1 shows the station code for each station.

Figure 2.2 shows the weighted graph modelling the High-Speed Rail (HSR) route from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. In this project, the issues are represented as graphs with weights on each edge. The graph model represents HSR stations as the vertices, and the distance between stations is assigned in kilometers to the edges.

According to the mathematical model, there are ten routes that can be chosen to get from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore by using the High-Speed Rail.
